  <h2 class="section-heading">1. Open the coupons Simulator</h2>
  <p>
  For the purposes of making test coupons call, you'll be using the coupons simulator in your Testing Pays account.
  </p>
  <p>
  To open the simulator interface, login to your Testing Pays account and click "OPEN" on the "coupons" bookmark on your dashboard. You'll see the following sections in your simulator:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Integrate: coding instructions in various languages to help you connect your code to the simulator.</li>
    <li>Debug: use the Live Log to watch transactions being processed in real-time. Or download the file-based logs.</li>
    <li>Test: a map of real coupon response codes that you can trigger with values in your test requests. Or custom your own.</li>
    <li>Reports: real-time test reports showing the frequency and coverage of your coupons testing.</li>
    <li>Settings: real-world settings you can activate for your testing like latency delays, trigger parameters, etc.</li>
  </ul>

<div class="docs-text-block" id="section-first-request">
  <h2 class="section-heading">2. Build the payload</h2>
  <p>
  The simplest option is using cURL. To create a Stripe coupon, at minimum you need an id, duration and currency. Using cURL, you need to submit these parameters as you would with a form POST.
  </p>

      <i class="fas fa-info-circle mr-2" ></i> Our Tip: create coupon that expire
    </h5>
    <p class="docs-card-text text-light">
    You can add more parameters to your coupons: max_redemptions, redeem_by, etc. this way you can limit how many times one can be redeemed and when your discount expired.

<div class="docs-text-block" id="section-first-request">
  <h2 class="section-heading">3. Making your first coupons request</h2>
  <p>
  Next, your code needs to send the assembled request to the coupons simulator. The URL to POST to can be found under the "Integration" tab of the simulator - make sure to copy&paste this URL from your simulator as it contains your unique API_KEY.
  </p>
  <p>
  The example shown below shows how to make a coupons request using cURL.
  </p>
  {% capture code_block %}{% include stripe/code/coupons-curl.html %}{% endcapture %}
  {% include docs/components/code-block.html content=code_block %}

{% include docs/components/text-block-divider.html %}

<div class="docs-text-block" id="section-response">
  <h2 class="section-heading">4. Parse the coupons response</h2>
  <p>
  The simulator will send back a JSON object that contains information about the coupon - echoing back your call details along with the defaults
  </p>
  {% capture code_block %}{% include stripe/code/coupons-json.html %}{% endcapture %}
