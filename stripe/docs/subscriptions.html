  <h2 class="section-heading">1. Open the subscriptions Simulator</h2>
  <p>
  For the purposes of making test subscriptions call, you'll be using the subscriptions simulator in your Testing Pays account.
  </p>
  <p>
  To open the simulator interface, login to your Testing Pays account and click "OPEN" on the "subscriptions" bookmark on your dashboard. You'll see the following sections in your simulator:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Integrate: coding instructions in various languages to help you connect your code to the simulator.</li>
    <li>Debug: use the Live Log to watch transactions being processed in real-time. Or download the file-based logs.</li>
    <li>Test: a map of real subscription response codes that you can trigger with values in your test requests. Or custom your own.</li>
    <li>Reports: real-time test reports showing the frequency and coverage of your subscriptions testing.</li>
    <li>Settings: real-world settings you can activate for your testing like latency delays, trigger parameters, etc.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

  <h2 class="section-heading">2. Build the payload</h2>
  <p>
  The simplest option is using cURL. To create a Stripe subscription, at minimum you need a customer id, plan (encapsulated in an items list) and tax_percent. Using cURL, you need to submit these parameters as you would with a form POST.

    <p class="docs-card-text text-light">
    You can add more parameters to your subscriptions: metadata, billing or trial period settings. The latter can be used to handle ‘first 14 days off’ kinda scenarios.

<div class="docs-text-block" id="section-first-request">
  <h2 class="section-heading">3. Making your first subscriptions request</h2>
  <p>
  Next, your code needs to send the assembled request to the subscriptions simulator. The URL to POST to can be found under the "Integration" tab of the simulator - make sure to copy&paste this URL from your simulator as it contains your unique API_KEY.
  </p>
  <p>
  The example shown below shows how to make a subscriptions request using cURL.

  {% capture code_block %}{% include stripe/code/subscriptions-curl.html %}{% endcapture %}

<div class="docs-text-block" id="section-response">
  <h2 class="section-heading">4. Parse the subscriptions response</h2>
  <p>
  The simulator will send back a JSON object that contains information about the subscription - echoing back your call details along with the defaults
  </p>
  {% capture code_block %}{% include stripe/code/subscriptions-json.html %}{% endcapture %}
  {% include docs/components/code-block.html content=code_block %}

    </h5>
    <p class="docs-card-text text-light">
  Save the subscription ID and connect it to your customer ID! This way you can always trace back a transaction, subscription data, etc. Subscription ID can be used to update a subscription: cancel, add more, modify current subscription items, etc.
