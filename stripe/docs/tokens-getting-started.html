    First, you’ll need an account on Testing Pays. It takes seconds.

  <h2 class="section-heading">1. Open the tokens Simulator</h2>
  <p>
  For the purposes of making test token call, you'll be using the tokens simulator in your Testing Pays account.
  </p>
  <p>
  To open the simulator interface, login to your Testing Pays account and click "OPEN" on the "tokens" bookmark on your dashboard. You'll see the following sections in your simulator:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Integrate: coding instructions in various languages to help you connect your code to the simulator.</li>
    <li>Debug: use the Live Log to watch transactions being processed in real-time. Or download the file-based logs.</li>
    <li>Test: a map of real token response codes that you can trigger with values in your test requests. Or custom your own.</li>
    <li>Reports: real-time test reports showing the frequency and coverage of your tokens testing.</li>
    <li>Settings: real-world settings you can activate for your testing like latency delays, trigger parameters, etc.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="docs-text-block" id="section-first-request">
  <h2 class="section-heading">2. Build the payload</h2>
  <p>
  the simplest option is using cURL. To create a Stripe token, at minimum you need a card[number], card[exp_month], card[exp_year] and card[cvc]. Using cURL, you need to submit these parameters as you would with a form POST.
  </p>
  <p>
  Add address details to your request. This can be used in billing and customer details later.

    </h5>
    <p class="docs-card-text text-light">
    Remember: you can trigger different responses from the simulator by the values you use in the requests. By default, the simulator will use cvc value as the trigger value.

  <h2 class="section-heading">3. Making your first charges request</h2>
  <p>
  Next, your code needs to send the assembled request to the tokens simulator. The URL to POST to can be found under the "Integration" tab of the simulator - make sure to copy&paste this URL from your simulator as it contains your unique API_KEY.

  <h2 class="section-heading">4. Parse the tokens response</h2>
  <p>
  The simulator will send back a JSON object that contains information about the card or bank account. These details can be saved safely in your own systems (i.e. the last 4 digits and the card type). You can show these to your customer(s), helping them to identify their preferred payment option - this is especially important when a customer has multiple cards saved.

  Take a look at an example response:

    </h5>
    <p class="docs-card-text text-light">
  Tokens are the single reference you need to create charges, so it’s essential to remember them. You need to use it when creating customers, subscribing to plans, etc.
