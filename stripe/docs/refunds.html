  <h2 class="section-heading">1. Open the refunds Simulator</h2>
  <p>
  For the purposes of making test refunds call, you'll be using the refunds simulator in your Testing Pays account.
  </p>
  <p>
  To open the simulator interface, login to your Testing Pays account and click "OPEN" on the "refunds" bookmark on your dashboard. You'll see the following sections in your simulator:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Integrate: coding instructions in various languages to help you connect your code to the simulator.</li>
    <li>Debug: use the Live Log to watch transactions being processed in real-time. Or download the file-based logs.</li>
    <li>Test: a map of real refund response codes that you can trigger with values in your test requests. Or custom your own.</li>
    <li>Reports: real-time test reports showing the frequency and coverage of your refunds testing.</li>
    <li>Settings: real-world settings you can activate for your testing like latency delays, trigger parameters, etc.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="section-heading">2. Build the payload</h2>
  <p>
  The simplest option is using cURL. To create a Stripe refund, at minimum you need a charge id and amount. Using cURL, you need to submit these parameters as you would with a form POST.

    </h5>
    <p class="docs-card-text text-light">
     You can add more parameters to your refunds: metadata, reason for refund or the application fee (for connected account). It's important to provide as much detail and metadata as possible for refunds.

  <h2 class="section-heading">3. Making your first refunds request</h2>
  <p>
  Next, your code needs to send the assembled request to the refunds simulator. The URL to POST to can be found under the "Integration" tab of the simulator - make sure to copy&paste this URL from your simulator as it contains your unique API_KEY.
  </p>
  <p>
  The example shown below shows how to make a refunds request using cURL.
  </p>
  {% capture code_block %}{% include stripe/code/refunds-curl.html %}{% endcapture %}

<div class="docs-text-block" id="section-response">
  <h2 class="section-heading">4. Parse the refunds response</h2>
  <p>
  The simulator will send back a JSON object that contains information about the refund - echoing back your call details along with the defaults
