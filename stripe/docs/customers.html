  <h2 class="section-heading">1. Open the customers Simulator</h2>
  <p>
  For the purposes of making test customers call, you'll be using the customers simulator in your Testing Pays account.
  </p>
  <p>
  To open the simulator interface, login to your Testing Pays account and click "OPEN" on the "customers" bookmark on your dashboard. You'll see the following sections in your simulator:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Integrate: coding instructions in various languages to help you connect your code to the simulator.</li>
    <li>Debug: use the Live Log to watch transactions being processed in real-time. Or download the file-based logs.</li>
    <li>Test: a map of real customer response codes that you can trigger with values in your test requests. Or custom your own.</li>
    <li>Reports: real-time test reports showing the frequency and coverage of your customers testing.</li>
    <li>Settings: real-world settings you can activate for your testing like latency delays, trigger parameters, etc.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="section-heading">2. Build the payload</h2>
  <p>
  The simplest option is using cURL. To create a Stripe customer, at minimum you need a source (this is the card or bank account token you get back from tokens). Testing Pays also require you to send in an `account_balance` to trigger the various test scenarios. Using cURL, you need to submit these parameters as you would with a form POST.

    <p class="docs-card-text text-light">
    Technically you donâ€™t need any params to create customer, but this makes it very hard to identify them later! Be sure you include `description` and `email`. You can also add metadata here too, like on all the other Stripe APIs.

<div class="docs-text-block" id="section-first-request">
  <h2 class="section-heading">3. Making your first customers request</h2>
  <p>
  Next, your code needs to send the assembled request to the customers simulator. The URL to POST to can be found under the "Integration" tab of the simulator - make sure to copy&paste this URL from your simulator as it contains your unique API_KEY.
  </p>
  <p>
  The example shown below shows how to make a customers request using cURL.

<div class="docs-text-block" id="section-response">
  <h2 class="section-heading">4. Parse the customers response</h2>
  <p>
  The simulator will send back a JSON object that contains information about the customer - echoing back your call details along with the defaults
