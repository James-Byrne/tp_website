    Your Testing Pays account provides features for you to test all aspects of your Stripe integration. You can concentrate on building the best payment features for your customers.

  <p>
    Testing Pays has powerful simulators for a subset of Stripe API endpoints. We currently offer the following API sims:
    <ul>
     <li>Charges<small> - for one-off transactions</small></li>
     <li>Tokens<small> - tokenising card data, reducing your PCI compliance level and increased security</small></li>
     <li>Subscriptions<small> - managing monthly / annual fee type transactions</small></li>
     <li>Customers<small> - managing your customer data for charges and subscriptions</small></li>
     <li>Coupons<small> - offer discounts and vouchers for your customers</small></li>
     <li>Refunds<small> - issue a refund to your customers based on a charge / subscription</small></li>
     <li>Webhooks<small> - trigger, parse and try out any webhook event!</small></li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    With a simple copy&paste, you can point your development and test environments at your Testing Pays account, then you're ready to send test transactions to the simulators - they'll respond as if your code is talking to the real thing.

    And the icing on the cake? Your simulators are just for you (and your team). Unlike traditional sandboxes, your simulators aren't shared with other merchants. Even better, you have control over the simulator settings, such as latency settings.

<div class="docs-text-block" id="section-response-maps-and-triggers">
  <h2 class="section-heading">Response Maps & Triggers</h2>

  <p>
    Each API simulator has a table of <b>all</b> possible API response codes. The table maps the response codes to request values. If you send in a value in your test request, then it will trigger the simulator to send back the response code it maps to in the table.
  </p>

  <p>The default trigger parameter is the <i>amount</i> value- you can trigger specific response codes with the last 2 digits in the value. You also have the option to use <i>card > cvc</i>, or others depending on the sim itself. Just select the trigger value you want in the Settings of the simulator you're testing.</p>

  <p>
   Say goodbye to crappy test cards. Enjoy testing <b>any</b> response you need when you need. Your imagination is your limit.

<div class="docs-text-block" id="section-integration-guides">
  <h2 class="section-heading">Integration Guides & Samples</h2>

  <p>
    Every simulator comes with integration guides, tips and links to sample apps. The instructions come in multiple coding languagues.

<div class="docs-text-block" id="section-test-reports">
  <h2 class="section-heading">Test Reports</h2>
  <p>
    Each simulator also comes with its own test report. As you and your team hit the simulator with test transactions, the reports will tell you what you've tested, what you haven't tested, the amount of response codes you've covered
  </p>

  <p>
    Use the test reports to: firstly capture how much coverage you're achieving with your current test plans, then to drive higher levels of coverage in your testing.

<div class="docs-text-block" id="section-live-logs">
  <h2 class="section-heading">Live Logs</h2>

  <p>
    Live Log gives you a window into each simulator as it processes your test requests. In real-time, you can see each transaction as it hits. The Live Log gives you visibility into how your request is treated, and the response being assembled and sent back. If the simulator finds a problem with your request, you'll also see verbose explanations in the Live Log.
  </p>

  <p>
    Everything is clearly timestamped so that you can be confident in the simulator roundtrip time for your testing. Simulator response time is consistently under 100ms - unless of course you've activated its 'latency' setting to introduce artificial overhead!

  <h2 class="section-heading">Load Test Simulators</h2>

  <p>
    Your checkout should <span style="text-decoration: underline">never</span> go down during Cyber Monday, Christmas sales or any peak sale event. So testing your store under load is vital. Our load test simulators can support your efforts.
  </p>

  <p>
      Use our load test simulators in conjunction with <a class="text-info" target="_blank" href="https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/performance-testing-tools-load-testing-tools/">a load test tool</a> to test your checkout. The simulators can handle millions of requests for overnight or weekend test runs, providing a constant response time of less than 100ms and concurrency up to 80 transaction per seconds.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our load test simulators must be booked in advance. To book, <a class="text-info" href="https://admin.testingpays.com/login">log into your Testing Pays account</a>, go to your "CURRENT TEAM" menu and complete the simple booking form. The team will respond within an hour with connection details.
