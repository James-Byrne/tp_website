<h1 class="page-heading">Testing 3D Secure Flows</h1>

<div class="docs-text-block">
  <p class="text-gray">
    The Connect simulator offers you the ability to try out 3D secure flows. Use the simulator to test and understand the customer experience when 3D secure is enabled for a Connect transaction.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray">
    To initiate the 3D secure flow, you need to include the <i>authenticateTransaction</i> parameter with the value ‘true’ in your requests.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray">
    If this is received, the simulator will redirect you to a simulated bank verification screen (also known as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-D_Secure#ACS_providers" class="doc-link">ACS</a> screen). On this screen, you can
    then select continue to successfully complete the 3D transaction, or select cancel to end the transaction.
