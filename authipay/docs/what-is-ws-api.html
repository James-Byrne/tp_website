<h1 class="page-heading">What is the WebServices API?</h1>

<div class="docs-text-block">
  <p>
    Authipayâ€™s WebServices API (WS API) is a comprehensive gateway to a wide range of online payments functions. It is an XML-based SOAP API. All examples in the Developer Playground use some sort of XML tree builder.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a developer, by going the WebServices route, you'll have more coding to do for your integration than by going the <a href="./what-is-connect.html">Connect API</a> route. On the flip side, WS API allows you to build much more powerful and slick customer payment features. In addition, WS API is the only option if your customer checkout has to be fully branded in keeping with the rest of your site.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Authipay Developer Playground can help you build these features better and faster. It provides powerful simulators for all core operations on the WS API. Whether you need to build a brilliant checkout flow for your customers, or give your operations team time-saving returns tools, the simulators can help you explore and trial these features.
