              The Developer Playground has powerful simulators for <i>every</i> Authipay API endpoint and operation. For example, there's a simulator for Authipay Connect, a simulator for 'card-sale', a simulator for 'card-void', etc.   
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray">
              With a simple copy&paste, you can point your development and test environments at your Playground, then start sending test transactions to the simulators - they'll respond as if your code is talkig to the real thing.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray">
              And the icing on the cake? Your simulators are just for you (and your team). Unlike traditional sandboxes, your simulators aren't shared with other merchants. Even better, you get to control your own simulator settings such as latency values.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Response Code Maps & Triggers</h2>

            <p class="text-gray">
              Each API simulator has a table of <i>all</i> its possible response codes. The table maps response codes to request values so that you can send in values in your test requests and trigger the response codes you want.  
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray">The default trigger parameter is the transaction amount... you pass in       different decimal value, you'll get different response codes. You can also use the card CVV     value or the Cardholder name as a trigger value - just select the trigger value you want in     the Settings of the simulator you're testing.</p>

            <p class="text-gray">
             Say goodbye to crappy test cards. Enjoy testing <i>any</i> response you need. Your imagination is your limit.

            <p class="text-gray">
              Each simulator also comes with its own test report. As you and your team hit the simulator with test transactions, the test reports will tell you what you've tested, what you haven't tested, the amount of response codes you've covered
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray">
              Use the test reports to: firstly capture how much coverage you're achieving with your current test plans, then to drive higher levels of coverage in your testing.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Live Logs</h2>

            <p class="text-gray">
              Live Log gives you a window into each simulator as it processes your test requests. In real-time, you can see each transaction as it hits. The Live Log gives you visibility into how your request is treated, and the response being assembled and sent back. If the simulator finds a problem with your request, you'll also see verbose explanations in the Live Log. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray"> 
              Everything is clearly timestamped so that you can be confident in the simulator roundtrip time for your testing. Simulator response time is consistently under 100ms - unless of course you've activated its 'latency' setting to introduce artificial overhead!
