              Authipay Connect provides online retailers with a hosted payment page for customer card payments. It works as straightforward POST of form data and, depending on the options you choose, results in your customer being redirected to the Authipay hosted payment pages.

            <p>
              Authipay Connect is a hosted payment page option. Here’s how it works:
            </p>
            <ol class="doc-list fw-300">
              <li>
                The customer on your site chooses to pay for an item.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your site sends the initial request to Connect. This contains parameters for the transaction, for example, the total amount to charge.
              </li>
              <li>
                Connect API responds with a HTTP (302) redirect.
              </li>
              <li>
                The paying customer is redirected to Authipay’s own checkout form.
              </li>
              <li>
                The customer completes the payment form presented by Authipay.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once completed, Authipay redirects the end-user back to a return URL specified in the initial request.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>

        </div>
      </div>

      {% include docs/components/whats-next.html
        text="Get going with Connect in the Developer Playground."
        link_href="./connect-getting-started"
        link_text="Getting Started"
      %}
