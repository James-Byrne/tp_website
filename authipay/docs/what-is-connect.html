<h1 class="page-heading">What is Authipay Connect?</h1>

<div class="docs-text-block">
  <p>
    Authipay Connect provides online retailers with a hosted payment page for customer card payments. It works as straightforward POST of form data and, depending on the options you choose, results in your customer being redirected to the Authipay hosted payment pages.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a developer, by going the Connect route you can minimise the coding required to add card payments to your site. By letting Authipay Connect handle your payments, you also have very little to worry about in terms <a class="doc-link" href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/">PCI data security</a> requirements.
  </p>

  <p>
    Authipay Connect is a hosted payment page option. Here’s how it works:
  </p>
  <ol class="doc-list fw-300">
    <li>
      The customer on your site chooses to pay for an item.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your site sends the initial request to Connect. This contains parameters for the transaction, for example, the total amount to charge.
    </li>
    <li>
      Connect API responds with a HTTP (302) redirect.
    </li>
    <li>
      The paying customer is redirected to Authipay’s own checkout form.
    </li>
    <li>
      The customer completes the payment form presented by Authipay.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once completed, Authipay redirects the end-user back to a return URL specified in the initial request.
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>
