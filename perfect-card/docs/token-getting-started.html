    Once you’ve signed in to the testing environment, and selected your favourite APIs you'd like to use, you’ll see your team Dashboard with bookmarks. Find the bookmark named “<span class="fw-500">card-token  (v1)</span>”, and click the OPEN SIM button.

    Go to the “Integrate” tab on the card-token simulator. This contains instructions and tips to get going in various coding languages. Select the coding language of your choice and follow the instructions.
  </p>
  <p>
  The first option you'll see on the "Integrate" tab is a <i>cURL</i> request - this is the quickest way to see a card-token request in action. Copy the cURL command and paste into your local command/terminal window, and hit return. The response from the simulator will contain a "CardId" parameter containing a string, with 2 digits at the very end, i.e. <i>CI0000<b>11</b></i>. For using the sims, the last 2 digits here will be important, as many of our sims' responses triggered by these.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-heading">4. How to use sim scenarios </h2>
  <p>
    All subsequent Perfect Card requests will depend on one common thing - a CardId. In simple cases, you can easily use the individual sim's mappings to trigger simple responses, like a validation error on card-details. In some cases however, you'd need to rely on a bit more complicated flow, like creating a virtual card, get details, update balance, check balance, etc. In the background we create a virtual card (well, a simulated virtual card, that is not real), and keep track of the balance of it, just like Perfect Card would in their live environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    <sub>
      * For test transactions to the simulator, set the CardId's last 2 digits to a value from the Test tab. This way you can trigger the various responses of that API.
    </sub>
  </p>

  <p>
  When you start with the card-token API, we generate a CardID that follows a certain scenario that stretches over the various Perfect Card sims. A scenario might include successful responses from the card-token and card-details sims but fail with a specific "Permissions was denied on that card" error on card-get-token.

    Not all payments and API requests follow the "happy path". In many cases you will find unusual behaviors. We recommend to check the pre-configured scenarios first, and add your own ones.
