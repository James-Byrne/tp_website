<h1 class="page-heading">What are the Perfect Card sims?</h1>

<div class="docs-text-block">
  <p>
  Perfect Card APIs are a simple way to create a virtual card with a certain amount. For example, each time you call <b>card-token</b>  API sim on Testing Pays, we create an individual MasterCard number, and assign it to a <b>CardId</b>. This CardId is returned to you - unless you have chosen to simulate an error, i.e. a System Error, or Invalid Currency code.
  </p>

  <p>
  Here you can choose a preconfigured scenarion in the Test tab - by which we can guarantee the outcome of the next call(s) you make to other Perfect Card sims. Like an IP Restriction error that fails on <b>card-details</b>. If you would like to do individual sim requests, regardless of the scenarios, just use the dedicated mapping tables of the sims.

    Perfect Card sims are dependent on each other, although they can be used individually. Hereâ€™s how a typical flow would work with them:
  </p>
  <ol class="doc-list fw-300">
    <li>
    Create a new virtual card, using the <b>card-token</b> call, which returns a <i>CardId</i> to be used in later calls.
    </li>
    <li>
    You supply this CardID along with the <i>CardToken</i> returned from the previous call to get the card's full details using the <b>card-details</b> API call.
    </li>
    <li>
    You can modify the balance of the card with <b>adjust-card-balance</b>, where the <i>Amount</i> will be either added or deducted from your balance - depends on whether you have sent a positive or negative value in this field.
    </li>
    <li>
    If the CardToken expired (after 60 seconds), you can request a new one, using your CardId. Just call the <b>card-get-token</b> API.
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>
