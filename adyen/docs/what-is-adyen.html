<h1 class="page-heading">What are the Adyen sims?</h1>

<div class="docs-text-block">
  <p>
  Adyen Payment APIs are a simple way to carry out ecommerce transactions: authorise, capture, refund, etc. For example you can simulate payment flows that start with a transaction being created, captured and refunded later. Or a flow where the authorised (but not yet captured) transaction is cancelled.
  </p>

  <p>
  Here you can choose a preconfigured scenarion in the Test tab - by which we can guarantee the outcome of the next call(s) you make to other Adyen sims. Like a Blocked Card response that's returned on <b>authorise</b>. If you would like to do individual sim requests, regardless of the scenarios, just use the dedicated mapping tables of the sims.

    Adyen sims are dependent on each other, although they can be used individually. Hereâ€™s how a typical flow would work with them:
  </p>
  <ol class="doc-list fw-300">
    <li>
    Start a new transaction, using the <b>authorise</b> call, which returns you the status for this transaction. You can initiate a <a href="./3d-secure-flow">3D Secure flow</a> as well, in this case you will get a bank sim URL (hosted on Testing Pays) and the necessary params (md and paRequest) to be sent there.
    </li>
    <li>
    Coming back from the 3D secure flow, you need to call the <b>authorise3d</b> sim first before any other call. This ensures your customer has completed their "Verified by Visa"-type tests on the bank's page.
    </li>
    <li>
    You can now <b>capture</b>* the transaction. This is when in the real world the money gets taken from the account.
    </li>
    <li>
    Before capture, you can still <b>cancel</b>* the transaction. After capture is completed you can only initiate a <b>refund</b>*
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p style="font-size: small">* capture, cancel and refund sims are coming soon!</p>
